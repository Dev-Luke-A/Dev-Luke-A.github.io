Privacy Policy:

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.

Data Collection: We do not collect any personal or sensitive user data through our platform. However, we may utilize anonymous analytics services provided by Google Play Console Analytics to collect usage data for the purpose of improving our app's performance and user experience. This data may include information such as the number of active users and their interactions with the app. The information collected is aggregated and does not personally identify individual users.

Data Handling Procedures: While we do not collect personally identifiable information, we prioritize security measures to ensure that any information generated during your use of our platform remains confidential and secure. Any analytics data collected is stored securely and used solely for the purpose of improving our app.

Data Retention and Deletion: Since we do not collect any user data, we do not have a data retention policy. Any data generated during your use of our platform, including analytics data, is not stored beyond the period necessary for the analytics service to provide insights.

Third-Party Services: Our app may utilize third-party services, such as Google Play Console Analytics, to improve functionality and user experience. These services may collect anonymous usage data as described above. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for more information on their data collection and handling practices.
